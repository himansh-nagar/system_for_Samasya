# system_for_Samasya


In this repo, I tried to make to small systems for samasya. 
The directory named main_system in this repo is the one in which I made the simple system by using Arrays objects and some middleware it is very simple and it can be extended easily.

And in the other directory named signup_system, I am saving the data of the user in Mysql with their roles if was given or else by default it will take customer.

By this, we can get the idea of how can this website work on a small level.
